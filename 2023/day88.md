# Monitoring, Alerting, Runbooks and On-Call

On-call practices
Good/Bad alerts
What to monitor
Who to alert, when and why? (think about your application - if single region B2B app then a 2AM callout when there’s no users is pointless!!)
Cost of on-call (emotional/monetary/morale) 
Psychological safety
Don’t incentivise bugs! 
Incident managers
Automatic incidents
Communication is key
DON’T PANIC
